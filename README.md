## 1. Introduction
This assignment is the final part of the module CTEC-3905. The task at hand has been to develop a website using HTML5, CSS and Javascript. This entailed creating wireframe sketches of the initial design, intelligently considering PARC principles, considering all angles of usability and accessibility. Mobile first design was a key area that was implemented from the onset of development. The following markdown file will detail all the stages of development and show how design considerations have been met and implemented.


#### 1.1. Rationale
The rationale for selecting a recipe website was due to the admiration for food and the love for cooking. Food is an every day part of life that requires an art in its own form. Cook books have have been transformed from hard copy books to users going on the World Wide Web to source information. However, the purist would say a hardback book is not as satisfying as using a wesbite.

## 2. Design Documentation
Wireframe sketches were outlined for the initial designs as shown using the linkes below. Within the wireframe sketches. PARC principles and usability has also been taken into consideration when initally designing the site, in which key areas are discussed below. These design decisions are also highlighted using notations within the sketches.

## 3. Features/Considerations

This section outlines the features and considerations that have been made in regards to the final implentation. It also provides a detailed explanation of how PARC, usability and accessibility have been accounted for. Liitations will also be accounted for with justifications.


- **Fixed Navigation** - A fixed navigation bar accounts for usability as the user does not have to scroll back to the to of the site to access other areas.
- **Smooth Scrolling** - Smooth scrolling allows the user to select a button and be automatically referenced to the relevant section. This ensures the user does not have to find the section whilst looking at irrelevant information that the user does not need.
- **Contrasting Images** - The navigation bar was designed to be a darker colour, whilst using a fixed image below to contrast this principle.
- **Multi-page Application** - As there will be a lot of content on the site in terms of ingredients and methods for recipes, a multi-page application was more suitable. This is due to single page application being more clean and un-distractive with as less content as possible.
- **No Bootsrap** - Although the bootstrap framework and any other framework likewise are very handy and powerful, this was ideally not the route to take as it would deter from the learning experience.
- **Recipes** - As recipes take up a lot of content on the page, in terms of usability it was decided that the ingredients and methods will be displayed within modal boxes. This ensures the site is not clogged with information that the user does not need.
- **Colour Co-ordination** - Pictures of recipes will contain colour coded annotations such as the colour green for vegetarion. Once again, the user will not click on a meat dish if they are a vegetarian. Therefore, this aligned with usability.
